# sveltejs-idea-plugin

Idea plugin for https://svelte.technology/[sveltejs] projects.

Svelte is a Javascript MVC framework for web applications which compiles to pure Javascript, requires no framework dependency in the browser and allows to render the application server side (SSR).

It works well with https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/micro-frontends[micro-frontend approaches] as described by https://github.com/gustafnk/microservice-websites/[Gustaf Nilsson Kotte] or https://micro-frontends.org/[Microfrontends.org].

## Usage
Install in Idea via Settings -> Plugins -> Browse repositories -> (search for) Svelte

Or download it from https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10021-svelte[the Jetbrains Plugin repository] and install it manually.

## For Plugin Developers
The plugin requires Intellij Ultimate for development, since it depends on the Javascript plugin.

### Run the Plugin
To start the plugin from Intellij, execute the runIde task from the list of intellij gradle tasks. It downloads a 2016.2 runtime and executes that version of intellij with the svelte plugin included.

### Build Distribution
Run the buildPlugin task. The distribution will be created in build/distributions. Upload to https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/edit?pluginId=10021[Plugin Repository].
