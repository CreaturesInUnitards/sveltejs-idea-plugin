# sveltejs-idea-plugin
Idea plugin for sveltejs components

## Usage
Install in Idea via Settings -> Plugins -> Browse repositories -> (search for) Vue.js

Or download it from here and install it manually: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10021-svelte

## For Plugin Developers
The plugin requires Intellij Ultimate for development, since it depends on the Javascript plugin.

### Run the Plugin
To start the plugin from Intellij, execute the runIde task from the list of intellij gradle tasks. It downloads a 2016.2 runtime and executes that version of intellij with the svelte plugin included.

### Build Distribution
Run the buildPlugin task. The distribution will be created in build/distributions.
